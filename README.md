Hi, I'm kiki!

Just recently I got into computers and started learning programming.
I'm also interested in cyber security.

I want to learn everything by myself without school etc.

Today (28/11/23) I started The Odin Project. I know basics of web development (HTML, CSS) and I can make a static website.
I'm looking forward to learn JS.

I use https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps roadmaps, very useful.

I will keep updating this README file every few days.

:)
